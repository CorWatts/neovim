# neovim config  

Install and set up everything by running `make`


`make dependencies` installs the dependencies via Homebrew  
`make symlinks` sets up the necessary symlinks  
`make clean` removes the symlinks  

Once that's done, open up neovim with `vi` and type `:PlugInstall` to get the plugins.
